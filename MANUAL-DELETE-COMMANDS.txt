Manual Commands to Delete Backup Files
=====================================

If the batch file doesn't work, you can run these commands manually:

Open Command Prompt (cmd) in your folder and run:

del *.backup
del *.search-backup  
del *.bak
del *.old
del *.orig
del *.temp

Or in PowerShell:
Remove-Item *.backup
Remove-Item *.search-backup
Remove-Item *.bak
Remove-Item *.old
Remove-Item *.orig
Remove-Item *.temp

These commands will safely delete only backup files.
Your original HTML files will remain untouched.
